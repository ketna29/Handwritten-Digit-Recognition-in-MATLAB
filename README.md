# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-in-MATLAB
Hnadwritten Digit Recognition using neural network in MATLAB.

Handwritten digit recognition system can be divided into four stages:

  a. Acquire a labelled data set with images of the desired object.
  b. Partition the data set into a training set and a test set.  When image is captured, it is in the grey scale format i.e. in the form of pixel density value between 0 to 255. In binarization, the grey scale image is thresholded and converted into binarized image in the form of 0 and 1.
  c. Train the classifier using features extracted from the training set. Feature extraction is the step that aims to extract relevant information b reducing the dimension of the data. 
  d. Test the classifier using features extracted from the test set.
